# Terraform Logging
Logging allows us to actively monitor/troubleshoot potential and current issues.

- Log immediately in the terminal: 

`TF_LOG=TRACE terraform apply`

- Log to file: 

`export TF_LOG_PATH=logs.txt`

> Note: Turn on logging for entire terminal session: 

`export TF_LOG=TRACE`

See the video for more information and examples.
